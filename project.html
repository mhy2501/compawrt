            <p><span>"W</span>ith so many stray animals like dogs and cats roaming freely on the streets and everywhere around us, trying to fend themselves to live,
            you might ask yourself, "How can I help this poor animals?" I am one of those asking myself about this question. Taking a domesticated animal as a pet is a big responsibility.
            One should be prepared mentally, physically and financially, so others might find that way a little burdening. But, keeping a stray animal is not the only way that you can help them.
            Giving them some leftover food might help them thrive for a day but giving them the chance to find a better home, a loving family and a comfortable life is a huge help for this animals. 
            And that's where the idea of this platform began. Reporting stray animals you see into your local shelter or to the organizations that cater the welfare of this animal has a big impact to them and to the society."
